I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), collaborating with Prof. Kun Zhang. I received my Ph.D. from Southeast University under the supervision of Prof. Changyin Sun.

My research interests include causal representation learning and reinforcement learning, with publications <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=LboR1toAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FYuewen-Sun%2FYuewen-Sun.github.io%2Fmain%2Fgoogle_scholar_crawler%2Fresults%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at top AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, and AAAI. My recent work focuses on multimodal causal representation learning and its applications in healthcare to address challenges in identifiability.
