<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), supervised by Prof. Kun Zhang. I received my Ph.D. from Southeast University under the supervision of Prof. Changyin Sun.

My research interests include causal representation learning and reinforcement learning, with publications <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=LboR1toAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at top AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, and AAAI. My recent work focuses on multimodal causal representation learning and its applications in healthcare to address challenges in identifiability.

[Identifying Latent State-Transition Processes for Individualized RL](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=kREpCQtHdN)

**Yuewen Sun**, Biwei Huang, Yu Yao, Donghuo Zeng, Xinshuai Dong, Songyao Jin, Boyang Sun, Roberto Legaspi, Kazushi Ikeda, Peter Spirtes, Kun Zhang

[**Project**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=kREpCQtHdN&referrer=%5BAuthor%20Console%5D(%2Fgroup%3Fid%3DNeurIPS.cc%2F2024%2FConference%2FAuthors%23your-submissions)) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We aim to identify the latent state-transition processes from observed state-action trajectories, facilitating the learning of personalized RL policies.
- Theoretical identifiability is guaranteed under both finite and infinite latent factor conditions, supporting the framework‚Äôs robustness.

[ACAMDA: Improving Data Efficiency in Reinforcement Learning Through Guided Counterfactual Data Augmentation](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/29442/30719)

**Yuewen Sun**, Erli Wang, Biwei Huang, Chaochao Lu, Lu Feng, Changyin Sun, Kun Zhang 

[**Project**](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/29442) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We employ counterfactual reasoning to generate augmented datasets, enabling agents to make unbiased decisions, and model causal relationships within the system to ensure adaptability across heterogeneous environments.

[Learning Temporally Causal Latent Processes from General Temporal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05428)

Weiran Yao<sup>\*</sup>, **Yuewen Sun<sup>\*</sup>**, Alex Ho, Changyin Sun, Kun Zhang (<sup>\*</sup>Equal contribution)

[**Project**](https://github.com/weirayao/leap) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We propose two provable conditions under which temporally causal latent processes can be identified from their observed nonlinear mixtures.
- We develop a theoretically-grounded training framework that enforces the assumed
conditions through proper constraints.
